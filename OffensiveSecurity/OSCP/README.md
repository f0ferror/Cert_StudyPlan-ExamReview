## BOF Study Guide
 https://infoinsecu.wordpress.com/2019/08/13/oscp-study-guide-buffer-overflow/ 

As we already know if you want to pass OSCP exam, you need to know how to build BoF code.

Before exam, I practiced building my own exploit code for BoF vulnerabilities including the one that I learned from the lab and course exercise. It’s easier to search BoF exploits on exploit-db and select the one that has a vulnerable app attached. You can use ruby or python code as a reference or someone’s github as a reference.
