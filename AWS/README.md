# AWS Certified Security Specialty Study Guide
This is the page; sharing my experience for AWS Certified Security Specialty Exam(Feb 2020) https://infoinsecu.wordpress.com/2020/02/17/aws-certified-security-specialty-study-guide/
Overall, it took me about 3 months for studying this exam with full-time 40hrs/week job. I’m pretty sure anyone who has more hands-on experience in AWS environment will take less than 3 months to pass this exam.

# Study Material

AcloudGuru Course; AWS Certified Security Specialty 2020 
LinuxAcademy Course; AWS Certified Security – Specialty Certification
BrainCert Practice Exam; AWS Certified Security – Specialty Practice Exams
AWS FAQ & WhitePapers & Re:Invent video
 

# Study Plan

I spent first two months listening ACloudGuru course and make my own notes, then watched LinuxAcademy. ACloudGuru course does cover all of exam topics, though you still need to fill more details based on AWS FAQ or whitepapers. I really like the structure of A Cloud Guru‘s, having summary video and practice quiz for individual chapter; where students can refresh their memory and go for further research & study based on quiz’s feedback. Linux Academy course has really useful feature; lab, where you can go into their temporary aws console and practice it. If you prefer to learn hands-on things, I would recommend LinuxAcademy.


*TIPS* since we are busy worker or have other things to do in real-life, it’s pretty tough to find extra time for studying. So I print out the courses’ summary/note in small&pocket size and read it during commute or lunch time at work. You can find summary&exam notes in github or quizlet; Brianlam38 github and Antoine_Sylvia quizlet 

After finishing online courses for 2 months, I started to practicing with exam simulator. I took ACloudGuru Exam Simulator and got 60 at first… and I realize that I’ve never studied this topic as scenario-based before. *Unlike AWS Practitioner Exam, Security Specialty Exam has a lot of scenario based questions and you get to choose either more reasonable or secure answer(depends on the questions, the answer can be cost-effective choice). So I practice with ACloudGuru & BrainCert and learned AWS security services within the real-life examples because I ended up reading bunch of AWS whitepapers and AWS Security Blogs articles based on feedback I got from each test.

By the time I got 95 score on ACloudGuru Exam Simulator, I decide to book the exam.I also took AWS Certified Security Specialty practice exam online; but this one doesn’t show how much score you got nor which question incorrectly.. So, you can buy a practice game (It was free for me since I got voucher code from previous AWS cert exam), if you want to see the level of difficulty of exam.

The level of exam is tougher than i thought. I’m glad that I pass. I will update more study plan & material I used for study on next posting.
